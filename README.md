SQL Query Examples
This document contains a set of foundational SQL queries for database interaction. Each query is designed to demonstrate a key function of SQL, including selecting specific columns, filtering data, ordering results, and limiting output.

The queries cover various tasks:

Retrieving data from a single table.

Filtering records based on specific criteria (e.g., 'In Process', 'Sales Rep').

Ordering results in both ascending and descending order.

Limiting the number of returned records.

Selecting all columns from a table.

This README provides a quick reference for common SQL operations.
